<p class="words"><center> According to the dataset, Woody Allen is the director with the most prominent age gaps featured in his films. Most notably, the 1992 dramedy Husbands and Wives stars Allen, 38 at the time, with 19-year old actress Juliette Lewis who played his young student and lover. Among the over 1,000 films included in the research, 1971 had the most films with a large age gap, the average being 52, followed by 50 in 2006 and 49 in 2002. Surprisingly, 1960 had the least, ranking an average of about 6 films with a major age gap. Since the #MeToo movement, these numbers are certainly changing. Actress Polly Kemp from the ERA 50:50 (Equal Representation for Actresses) organization told The Guardian in 2022, "I suspect given whatâ€™s happened in the last few years, that there is a reluctance perhaps to have very young people in sexual relationships with older men on film." </p></center>
